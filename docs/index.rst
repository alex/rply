RPLY
====

Welcome to RPLY! A pure Python parser generator, that also works with RPython.
It is a more-or-less direct port of David Beazley's awesome PLY, with a new
public API, and RPython support.

To start using RPly head over to :doc:`users-guide/lexers` to learn how to
generate lexers, and :doc:`users-guide/parsers` after that to see how you can
turn the tokens generated by your lexer into something more useful.
